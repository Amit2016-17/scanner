=======

Scanner is a system for efficient video processing and understanding at scale.
Scanner provides a python API for expressing computations and a distributed
runtime for scheduling these computations onto clusters of machines with
CPUs and/or GPUs.

Scanner is an active research project, part of a collaboration between Carnegie
Mellon and Stanford University. Please contact
`Alex Poms <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~apoms/>`_ and

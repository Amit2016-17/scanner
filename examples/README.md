# Scanner examples

This directory contains a number of simple examples and full applications that show you how to use Scanner. It contains:

## Tutorials
* [Walkthrough.ipynb](https://github.com/scanner-research/scanner/blob/master/examples/Walkthrough.ipynb): an IPython notebook that goes through a simple application (shot detection) using Scanner.
* [tutorial](https://github.com/scanner-research/scanner/blob/master/examples/tutorial): a set of well-commented files exploring different Scanner features in code.

## Applications
* [face_detection](https://github.com/scanner-research/scanner/blob/master/examples/face_detection): Location and recognizing faces in a video.
* [shot_detection](https://github.com/scanner-research/scanner/blob/master/examples/shot_detection): Segmenting a video into shots. Same application as the walkthrough.
* [reverse_image_search](https://github.com/scanner-research/scanner/blob/master/examples/reverse_image_search): Searching through a video by image.
* [depth_from_stereo](https://github.com/scanner-research/scanner/blob/master/examples/depth_from_stereo): Computing a per-pixel depth image from two views of the same location.
* [hyperlapse](https://github.com/scanner-research/scanner/blob/master/examples/hyperlapse): Creating more stable timelapse videos with the [Hyperlapse](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/real-time-hyperlapse-creation-via-optimal-frame-selection/) algorithm.

## Op examples
* [caffe](https://github.com/scanner-research/scanner/blob/master/examples/caffe): How to use different Caffe nets in Scanner.
* [halide](https://github.com/scanner-research/scanner/blob/master/examples/halide): Integrating Halide kernels into Scanner.
* [opticalflow](https://github.com/scanner-research/scanner/blob/master/examples/opticalflow): Using OpenCV to compute flow fields within a video.
